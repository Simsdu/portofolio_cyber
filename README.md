# CTF and Wargame Write-Ups
This repository contains detailed write-ups for **Capture The Flag** (CTF) challenges and **Wargames** i have completed. It currently includes content from *TryHackMe* and *OverTheWire*, with additional platforms to be added over time.
The purpose of this repository is to:
  - Document my learnings process in Cybersecurity
  - Build a rigorous methodology
  - Track technical progress
  - Provide structured and clear explanations of each challenges

Each write-up includes a description of the challenge, the methodology used, the commands executed during the process and notes aimed at understanding rather than memorizing steps.

## Platform covered
**TryHackMe**
A wide range of cybersecurity labs covering web exploitation, privilege escalation, networking, malware analysis, and more. This sections includes write-ups for the room i have completed.

Wargame designed to teach practical fundamentals: Linux basics, permissions, cryptography, binary exploitation, and other core skills.
Currently progress includes the *Bandit* wargame, with additional wargames to come.
